## What will you find here?

This blog is intended to be a place where we share the challenges we face in doing what we like to call "work". So for the most part, the posts will not be in any particular order. You can read them in any order you like.

But maybe one day (nothing planned yet) we will also publish a series of organized articles that are best read in a suggested order. You can be sure we will let you know. But that's for the future.

## Ask if you have questions

Please feel free to ask questions if something is unclear and you need more clarification. Comments are at your disposal.
